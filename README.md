# Update OpenRex SD card with Linux
Go to OpenRex board, interrupt uBoot booting process (press any key). Then write following commands:


    run update_kernel;run update_fdt;reset


Note: if you would like to test the kernel without saving it to SD card, go to uBoot and use following commands:


    tftp 0x12000000 imx6/zImage-imx6q-openrex; tftp 0x18000000 imx6/imx6q-openrex.dtb;bootz 0x12000000 - 0x18000000
